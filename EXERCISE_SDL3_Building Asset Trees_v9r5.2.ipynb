    "\n",
    "Asset trees are a foundational tool that can be used to wrangle the full analytic capabilities of Seeq's software. They sort physical locations, pieces of equipment, and data on that equipment into a hierarchical structure. Organizing your data into an asset tree allows you to:\n",
    "- Utilize asset swapping to rapidly create identical visualizations for different pieces of equipment\n",
    "- Write high-value calculations for your components and scale them across all components in your tree\n",
    "- Automatically generate scalable content and custom analyses\n",
    "- Use your tree as a starting point for roll-ups, calculations, displays, dashboards, and reports\n",

    "## Step 1: Build a CSV File\n",
    "In this course, we will start by creating a tree with a custom structure defined by a CSV (comma-separated values) file. When this file is given as input to `spy.assets.Tree`, SPy will look at each row in the file, find an item in Seeq corresponding to the row, and place it into a newly created asset tree at the specified location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following columns are required in your CSV file.  \n",
    "- **Name** tells SPy what item to pull from the Seeq Server.\n",
    "- **Level** tells SPy where in the tree to put the item.\n",
    "  - If a level column is empty for a particular row, then the rows above are referred to. For example, the third row above has levels *My CSV Tree*, *Cooling Tower 1*, and *Area B*.\n",
    "- **Friendly Name** tells SPy what to call the item after putting it in the tree.\n",
    "- **ID** <i>(optional)</i> column can help SPy find items from Seeq Server that don't have unique names.\n",
    "\n",
